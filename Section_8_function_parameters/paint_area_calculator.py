# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.

# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

# number of cans = (2 \* 4) / 5
#                = 1.6
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

import math

def paint_calc(height, width, coverage):
    cans = (height * width) / coverage
    return int(math.ceil(cans))

test_h = int(input("Height of wall: ")) # Height of wall (m)
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: ")) # Width of wall (m)
coverage = 5
print(paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, coverage=coverage))

# or this works
print(paint_calc(test_h, test_w, coverage))
